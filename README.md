# Docker: Practical Use in the Microservices Scenario

This repository is a fork of the [original project](https://github.com/denilsonbonatti/toshiro-shibakita) by Denilson Bonatti. The goal of this project is to implement a microservices structure using Docker, following the best practices in the international market.

## Prerequisites

I am undertaking this project with basic knowledge in Linux, Docker, and AWS.

## The Challenge

In this challenge, I am replicating (and hopefully improving) this practical project, creating my own repository and thereby increasing my portfolio of projects on GitHub! I am inspired by the story of TOSHIRO SHIBAKITA and I'm excited to evolve with the help of the Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏èüòç‚òÅÔ∏è

Tip: I have forked the GitHub Repository (aka, "Guia Melzinho na Chupeta") to organize my changes and evolutions, keeping a direct reference to the original code.
